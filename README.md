# IVAM
A fully automatic method, the Integrated Voxel Analysis Method (IVAM) diagnoses Alzheimer's Disease in structural MRI images and locates affected regions. IVAM found a region responsible during the onset of Alzheimer's Disease located between the occipital and parietal lobes as a gyrus or sulcus. Doctors can use IVAM to identify other regions on the 3D MRI image classified voxel-by-voxel.
