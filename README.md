# IVAM
A fully automatic method that diagnoses Alzheimer's Disease in structural MRI images and locates affected regions. Armen Aghanjanyan and I created this algorithm to compete in the Central Sound Regional Science and Engineering Fair (2nd place in Health and Medicine) and the Washington State Science and Engineering Fair (1st place in Computational Biology).

Instructions:
Download the spatially normalized OASIS dataset. Download the python files. Open OASIS.py in Spyder and run with path changed to OASIS MRI image folder.
